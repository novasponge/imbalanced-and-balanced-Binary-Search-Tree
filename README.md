## BST and Left Leaning Red Black BST in Ruby

### Binary Search Tree

* Provides O(log(n)) runtime complexity for put, get, and delete in average cases and O(n) in worst case.  

### Left Leaning Red Black BST

* Guaranteed O(log(n)) runtime complexity for put, get and delete in all cases by dynamically balancing BST for put, get, and delete.
